            I&apos;m going back to school‚Ä¶ well, sort of. I thought it would be fun to work through all of the projects
            that I was assigned while attending the Turing School of Software and Design. I want to note how I think about
            the problems now, as a senior developer, and record my learnings and struggles. Spending almost a decade as a
            full stack web developer, I&apos;m noticing a disconnect from the expectations of the job and some of the
            foundational skills that sparked my passion for coding in the first place. Let&apos;s see where this journey
            back to school(work) takes us.
          </p>
          <h3>how it all started</h3>
          <p>
            Ten years ago I was sitting in a newsroom, producing the local 10pm news and dreaming of a better life for
            myself. ‚ÄúWhat would have happened if I pushed myself to make my coding hobby a professional reality?‚Äù I thought
            to myself while watching the indie game Five Nights At Freddy&apos;s take the scene by storm. I spent a few
            years in the 90s learning how to code static websites with HTML and simple programs with BASIC reading my
            dad&apos;s old textbooks. I loved it so much that I took C++ and Java classes in high school, but I was young
            and wanted pursue a career in film or music. By the time I got to college, coding was nothing more than
            something I did on the side to mod a computer game or spruce up my film contracting site.
            <br><br>
            In 2016, I decided to take the risk and reignite my passion for computers. I enrolled in the Turing School of
            Software and Design. I was excited, anxious and overwhelmed. The curriculum embraced ‚Äújust in time‚Äù learning.
            Unlike other popular code bootcamps, Turing spends a lot of time teaching the foundations of programming before
            introducing web development libraries and frameworks.

          <h3>my commitment</h3>
          <p>
            We had up to two weeks to complete each of the projects above and spent about 60-80 hours a week at school.
            Obviously, I don&apos;t have the freedom of focusing full time on each of these projects; however, I believe
            that setting a deadline for each project is necessary to force solutions and drive outcomes. I commit to spend
            a minimum of an hour a day and will set the delivery date for each project as double the expected time. Along
            with sharing the repo of each project on Github, I will also post my experience and thoughts of working through
            it. See you all on the other side.
